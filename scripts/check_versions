# Checks that if we're modifying a Debian package we're bumping the version
# number. This is a very rough check, we assume any folder with a BUILD file is
# a Debian package and that any changes to any files in the folder are
# meaningful and require a version bump. This has some false positives (e.g.
# changing a comment) but can always ignore the check if it's really, truly, a
# false positive (or bump the version anyway, besides mesa our packages are
# small).
